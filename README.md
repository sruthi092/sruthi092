- 👋 Hi, I’m Sruthi

I am a CS graduate :mortar_board: from Texas State University. Living in Texas :star:
I believe that master’s in computer science helped me in abridging the gap between what I know and what I need to possess.


When I am not coding, I am usually singing my heart out :musical_note: or inventing a new recipe. 
I love gardening. It gives the mental satisfaction to grow a plant from its seed. It is natural that I feel stronger and happier when I move back from my small home garden to everyday activities. 
It helps relieve even the worst stress.
